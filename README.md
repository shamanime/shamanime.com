# Jefferson Queiroz Venerando's blog

## About this blog
I decided that it was the time for me to start blogging. After some hours of research, I didn't find or felt good to try a blog powered by Rails.  
So, I decided to code my own simple blog platform, using Rails 3.1, Mongoid, Twitter Bootstrap and Disqus.  
This is intended to be a simple blog system, I will add more features as I need them.

## Motivation
I am taking this as an opportunity to improve my coding skills and to share what I've learned with others.  
Feel free to fork, edit and send me pull requests.
